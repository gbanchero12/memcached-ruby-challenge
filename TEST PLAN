#Before :
1. Run servera.rb
2. Run client.rb and type the next commands evaluating the result:

# Test Case 1
# Assert that returns the word false in the result of the command
# Command 'get test1'
# Precondition: key test1 is deprecated
# Expected result false

# Test Case 2
# Assert that return a result with a value from a stored key
# Command 'get test2'
# Precondition: key test2 is stored
# Expected result 'VALUE test2 0 2020-07-01T00:04:00+00:00 12
#                   test_value_2'

# Test Case 3
# Assert that can set a new key with a value
# Command 'set test 1 900 4 test_value'
# Precondition: -
# Expected result 'STORED'

# Test Case 4
# Assert that can get the case_unique from a stored pair
# Command 'gets test'
# Precondition: test is stored in the hash
# Expected result '(cas_unique_key)'

# Test Case 5
# Assert that can ADD a new pair
# Command 'add test 1 900 4 test'
# Precondition: test isn't stored in the hash
# Expected result 'STORED'

# Test Case 6
# Assert that canÂ´t ADD a pair stored before
# Command 'add test 1 900 4 test'
# Precondition: test is stored in the hash
# Expected result 'NOT_STORED'
